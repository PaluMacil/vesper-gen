# vesper-gen
A simple library viewer for the vesper icons font icon library... This is a Flask web app written in Python. Really there is hardly any code. It simply parses the CSS file into a web page showing all icons in the file.

The font icons are from https://github.com/kkvesper/vesper-icons and may be used very permissively without attribution, but I'd still like to thank the creators:
